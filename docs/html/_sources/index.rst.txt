Welcome to Telescope Scheduler's documentation !
=========================================================

A scheduler for observations on a high-cadence telescope.

Main objective:
    - given a list of positions in the sky
    - maximize the number of positions which are observed at least three times
    - respecting a minimum interval between consecutive observations of the same position

The source code is available `here <https://github.com/joaopedroso/telescope_scheduler>`_.
